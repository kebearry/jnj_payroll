This is a pure nodeJS solution to solution to generate and communicate payslip for every employee. While this is an automated cron job that has been scheduled once a month on the first day of the month at 00.00, this UI is for demonstration purpose to trigger the payslip generation and sending of emails.  A live environment for this app can be accessed at [Payslip Generator](https://5rd9wixb27.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dev/)

### Technical Contraints
* AWS Free Tier Limit
* MailTrap Free Tier Limit (<500 total emails to be sent and throttled email per second)

 ## How Cloud Deployment Was Done
 1) AWS CloudFormation template is created from serverless.yml
 2) If a Stack has not yet been created, then it is created with no resources except for an S3 Bucket, which will store zip files of the function code
 3) The code of the function(s) is then packaged into zip files.
 4) Serverless fetches the hashes for all files of the previous deployment (if any) and compares them against the hashes of the local files
 5) Serverless terminates the deployment process if all file hashes are the sam
 6) Zip files of functions' code are uploaded to S3 Bucket.
 7) The CloudFormation Stack is updated with the new CloudFormation template
 8) Each deployment publishes a new version for each function in your service
 9) Handler defines what function to execute upon lambda invocation
 10) This serverless approach has created a lambda function with respective api gateways and cloudwatch logging mechanism
